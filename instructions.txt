Instructions to run the RAG Project's Embedding Database Builder:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher recommended).
    *   Install `ollama` and have your chosen embedding model (e.g., "llama2") running. You can start Ollama by running `ollama run [EMBEDDING_MODEL]` in your terminal.
    *   Install the required Python packages. Navigate to the project root directory (`D:\RAG_Project`) in your terminal and run:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Make sure your `.env` file is configured with `EMBEDDING_MODEL` (e.g., `EMBEDDING_MODEL="llama2"`).

2.  **Purpose of `build_db.py`:**
    This script reads cat facts from `docs/cat-facts.txt`, generates embeddings for them using Ollama, and stores these embeddings in a ChromaDB instance located in the `chroma_db` directory. This database is then used by `rag_app.py` for retrieval-augmented generation.

3.  **How to Run `build_db.py`:**
    Navigate to the project root directory (`D:\RAG_Project`) in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    python build_db.py
    ```
    This will create or update the `chroma_db` directory with the embedded documents.

4.  **Rebuilding the Database:**
    If you need to rebuild the database (e.g., after changing the `cat-facts.txt` file or the embedding model), you must first delete the `chroma_db` folder. Then, rerun the `python build_db.py` command.
